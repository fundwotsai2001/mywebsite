            Hello! I’m Fang Duo Tsai (蔡芳鐸), a master's student from the Music and AI Lab at National Taiwan University, 
            advised by the wonderful <a href="https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?id=1090726">Prof. Yi-Hsuan Yang</a>. 
            I am working on Controllable Music Generation with <a href="https://slseanwu.github.io/">Shih-Lun Wu</a> 
            as my mentor, and we published <a href="https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2506.18729">MuseControlLite</a> to ICML 2025 and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16564">AP-adapter</a> to ISMIR 2024.
            <br><br>
            Prior to joining the Music and AI Lab, I received my B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from National 
            Taiwan University. During my undergraduate studies, I worked with <a href="https://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/ycwang.html">Prof. Yu-Chiang Wang</a> 
            on text-to-image and <a href="https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile2.php?id=306">Prof. Hung-Yun Hsieh</a> on WIFI motion detection. 
            Additionally, I interned at <a href="https://www.realtek.com/">Realtek</a>, working on audio encoding.
